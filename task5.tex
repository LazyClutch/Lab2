\section*{Task 5: Access control}
\begin{enumerate}
\item % 5 (a)
  ((Description of capabilities))\\
  The server can encrypt the capability list of a user with its private key and then send it to the user as a cookie. When the user makes a request, the server will receive the cookie, decrypt it with its public key, and verify that the user is authorized to make the request. As SSH keys have the property of [something][add citation], only the server can create these encrypted capability lists; malevolent users cannot forge them directly.

((Mention that the cookie can be delegated. Storing an encrypted user ID in the cookie would be good to determine the origin of the capability))\\
((Replay attacks would still be a problem.))\\
